## About the Site üöÄ

Blockchain-based eCommerce warranty system using NFTs
The objective is to replace the physical warranty and have block chain based warranty using NFT which will ensure
authenticity and security.

<br>

‚óè Converting ownership authenticity and product warranty cards into decaying NFTs.
‚óè For instance, allow brands and retailers to introduce an NFT for each of their products, which allows
customers to receive the physical product along with a digital version of it.
‚óè Customers can then use the digital NFT to verify the authenticity of their product, prove their ownership of
their product, and transfer ownership of them upon resale.
‚óè The brand/retailer should also be able to tie the digital NFT to its warranty program, allowing owners to track
repairs and replacements to the original item.
‚óè Decay the NFT once the warranty is over.
‚óè You can use the Polygon blockchain to deploy your solution and demo the final product as a web prototype
